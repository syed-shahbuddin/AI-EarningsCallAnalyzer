# Nonanswer Detection in Earnings Call Transcripts

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project was built for the **Gen AI Visionaries 2025** competition by **Team Fintech Mavericks**.

A multinational financial consulting firm needed an AI solution to detect evasive or vague responses â€” also known as *nonanswers* â€” in earnings call transcripts. Traditional NLP systems failed to adapt to varied speaking styles, and manual analysis was slow and costly.

Our solution leverages a **fine-tuned GPT-2 model** for classification, enhanced with **LLaMA 3.1** for reasoning, and is deployed via a lightweight, scalable Streamlit interface.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We used a labeled dataset of earnings call Q&A responses. Originally imbalanced, we added **synthetic samples generated by LLMs** to balance the data:

- **Total samples**: 1,740  
- **Answers**: 903  
- **Nonanswers**: 834

This ensured robust model performance across both classes.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Architecture

1. **Input Transcript**  
   Raw text from earnings call Q&A sessions.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Text is cleaned and tokenized; labels are mapped to binary classes.

3. **Model Fine-Tuning**  
   We fine-tuned **GPT-2** on the processed dataset to classify responses as answers or nonanswers.

4. **Explainability Layer**  
   **LLaMA 3.1** was used to generate justifications for each classification.

5. **Deployment**  
   Built with **Streamlit**, using **Groq API** for low-latency inference.
