"We'll look at the opportunity geographically, we'll look at it by the types of firms that we're selling to, the different sites of users or workflows within those firms, lots of different ways of looking at it.",answer

"On the MG&A line, <UNK>, the way to think about that, we do have incremental expense modeled in 2015 related to incentive compensation normalized, having normalized accrual rates on incentive compensation.",answer
For the year that is a little over $20 million as a Company.,answer
"So you will see a much lower number there, which pulls through on the NIM side.",answer
"One could argue, you don't necessarily pay for it in net interest income, but you pay for it on the tax line.",answer
"But, to get back to your question, I would say to 2 to 3 to 4 basis points a quarter is well within our expectations in terms of straight core margin decline, and some of that gets offset in the quarters where we pick up the Federal Reserve Bank dividend.",answer
"So sort of balancing that back to a 2 or 3 type expectation, probably safe to model that way.",answer
"Without getting into specific numbers, it was a little bit above 200.",answer
"You know, the things we've been talking about.",answer
"And we've probably had the equivalent of about, to date, probably about a 15% to 20% increase in headcount.",answer
That's something we did very aggressively in Q4 because we wanted to be prepped up for the year.,answer
"As it is, we've had a really very good onboarding of some of those people.",answer
We've had a really good attraction kind of strategy.,answer
"And, of course, then it's going to take some time for them to bring up, to get productive throughout the year.",answer
"I think the other thing that we probably didn't mention is selling this more upfront, we have found that typically our model was sell them payroll, then come back and say do you need HR services in three months or six months.",answer
"We're selling much more up front, if we think the client is of a 20 plus in a complexity we will go in and team sell.",answer
I think we're winning more clients right up front an ASO or PEO basis.,answer
Good question.,non-answer
"The answer is yes, we do.",answer
"Although, for example, we reported, I believe last year about 580,000 clients.",answer
"And the only thing I can think to add there is we do have the same overlap on to our e-mail approach, which I think is working well.",answer
"Yes, good morning, <UNK>.",non-answer
"It's possible that there could be another one or two added, but for planning stages, it's getting a little late, so I would -- my best guess is that we'll stay at nine.",answer
"Okay, with no other calls coming in then or questions coming up, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today and wish everyone a great weekend.",non-answer
"Thank you, <UNK>, and good morning.",non-answer
2014 was an excellent year for Repligen.,non-answer
"So we monitor that portfolio regularly, and it is continuing to perform sufficiently well for us at this point, consistent with the rest of the commercial portfolio as a whole.",answer
Very good.,non-answer
"Thank you, Nicole.",non-answer
"Thanks to everyone for joining us here today, and we will talk again next quarter.",non-answer
Thank you.,non-answer
"If I was going to build a model, I would do it a little less than linear, so a little less than one-third in second quarter -- sort of how I think about it.",answer
"Details of special items, which include the impact of non-operating investments, asset impairments and restructuring charges, are available on our website, along with additional information on discontinued operations.",non-answer
Now let's focus on earnings-per-share from ongoing operations.,non-answer
The key components of variance for the quarter and full year were similar.,non-answer
So I'll focus my comments on the full year.,non-answer
"In 2014, as I mentioned, earnings-per-share from ongoing operations was $1.13 per share compared to $1.15 in the prior year.",answer
Key drivers were as follows.,non-answer
"It really is one of those things, I think it's a very significant point, because it shows -- it basically shows a, if you will, getting to a certain level of maturity and jumping the hurdle in terms of these options simulation on a broader base.",answer
No.,non-answer
"And that's why, if you look at the headlines, the word solely was inserted in there, so that the only significant modification we've made from when we guided back in November is roughly 3% to 4% related to currency for the full year.",answer
"We call that our hedging docket, which is going to be open this year and hopefully completed this year.",answer
That will tell us whether we've got the right amount of gas reserves in our portfolio or not.,answer
"Hopefully, we'll get through that this year and it will give some direction on a future deal.",answer
"Maybe just a little bit more follow up on the first part of your question, <UNK>, which was about over-earning.",non-answer
"It does, in those cases where we're, as I said, spending more than $10 million, prevent us from over-earning in those years, but I would also say that the important part of this docket, I want to underscore, was the costs of this are large for the Company in the future.",answer
Our goal here was to make sure we got full recovery and the order does do that.,answer
We really believe that this is a very reasonable path forward for us.,answer
Any other questions.,non-answer
"Well, if there are no other questions, thank you all for joining us this morning.",non-answer
"Yes, briefly on the buybacks, our range always includes various scenarios.",answer
"And given our track record, I think it's safe to say our scenarios would include some level of buyback.",answer
Great.,non-answer
I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.,non-answer
"As a reminder, the press release, which is available on gapinc.com, contains a full recap of our fourth-quarter results, as well as the forward-looking guidance included in our prepared remarks.",non-answer
And as always the Investor Relations team is available after the call for further questions.,non-answer
Thank you.,non-answer
"And like I said, I think desktop subscriptions will have a more consistently increasing profile, whereas I think EBAs will still be subject to that seasonality.",answer
But I think both will continue on an upward trend.,answer
But what I was referencing -- both of those substantially grew.,answer
Yes.,non-answer
"One of the things I would say is that, as you work your models, it's very different when you're at 13% or 15% because your expenses and revenue aren't aligned.",answer
"When it about -- because of the way we account for it, in some ways you're putting money in the bank.",answer
"Both ASO, PEO, and what we call our HR essentials product which is more telephonic support, HR light, HR outsourcing light, the second is our retirement services business and third, insurance.",answer
Nothing's changed there.,answer
Those are all businesses that are growing nicely and performing well within the portfolio.,answer
Your biggest followed by the next biggest followed by the smallest.,answer
All right.,non-answer
Thank you.,non-answer
At this point we will close the call.,non-answer
"If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived until approximately April 25.",non-answer
"In terms of modeling for free cash flow, to be consistent with what we have -- how we have modeled in the past, and that is, if you look at our EBITDA, our EBITDA is a range of $280 million to $290 million.",answer
"Cash taxes would be deducted from that, so $25 million to $30 million, cash interest $36 million, CapEx in the $40 million to $50 million range.",answer
"The expectation would be that cash flow would be in that, call it, mid-to-high $170 million range.",answer
I don't expect the balance sheet to be a headwind in 2015.,answer
I would expect the balance sheet to be a tailwind.,answer
"So I expect at the end of the day as we look forward with the 45 centimeter and 60 centimeter, it will be 50-50 columns of media as more and more customers take advantage of large volume discounts they get from the media suppliers themselves.",answer
Good morning.,non-answer
Two points I would draw you back to.,non-answer
"If you went back a year and looked at Q3 of fiscal year 2014, one of the things you would have heard the team talk about at that point in time was accruing infrastructure we put in place for our new construction business.",answer
And that was a pretty severe drag on margin in that particular quarter.,answer
"I think you will see in the filings which will be out right after this call that we've got an unhedged guarantee position at present of I think quite a modest between $40 million and $50 million, and so we will see what comes forward.",answer
There's a bunch of opportunity.,answer
"Some of it we hedge, some of it we hold, and sometimes our decisions are extremely rewarding and sometimes they're not.",answer
"I think as the Company sees opportunity that it's confident in, it will continue to deploy capital.",answer
"While Mike will discuss the future prospects for this business in some greater detail, we are very comfortable saying that we expect this segment to continue making significant earning contributions for 2015 and beyond.",answer
"Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'll provide a quick update on the balance sheet.",non-answer
Our year end equity cap ratio was 43%.,answer
"We averaged 44% for most of the year, which is comparable to the 2013 levels.",answer
"Yes, we had pushed out several deals and our expectation is those deals will close in 2015.",answer
"Some will close in Q2, and some will close later.",answer
"I'm sorry, Q1, and some will be later.",answer
"Thanks, everybody, for dialing in.",non-answer
We look forward to talking to you all in the next coming weeks.,non-answer
I'll give you a general on the pipe.,non-answer
"Every year we always say that we have such scale that will I be sitting here in a year from now here telling you that I had 22,000 23,000 shows.",non-answer
Yes.,non-answer
We have no fear that our global staff - were the best at it.,non-answer
We will continue to get our share of the market and slightly more.,non-answer
I am truly excited about all of the opportunities that lie in front of us.,non-answer
"With that, I will turn the call over to <UNK> <UNK> for an operational update.",non-answer
"Thank you, <UNK>.",non-answer
"For the quarter, revenue was $301 million and earnings were $0.28 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.27 on an adjusted basis.",answer
"For the year, we generated $1.2 billion in revenue and earned $0.40 per share on a GAAP basis from continuing operations.",answer
"There were numerous adjustments detailed in our press release, the majority of which related to our restructuring efforts in the first half of the year.",answer
"So they tend to be things like business development-related outcomes, technology-related expenses.",answer
"And what we have found is that activity levels on the revenue production side of our income statements go down, so goes down some of our operating expenses.",answer
"So we have got some linear outcomes, things like IT processing, transactional processing, and a handful of our IT environments that actually move down or move in sync with the revenue generation.",answer
"I think we -- first of all, we have some good programs, as I mentioned earlier, industrial, medical, and defense that we're able to diversify the customer base in the last 12 months.",answer
So we have some of those programs to help us.,answer
Same thing in embedded computing and storage.,answer
"We've got some new customers that we got qualified, and that's really what we are counting on.",answer
"Now, at the same time, we are positioned to win some programs, but we are not putting those at the forecast at this time.",answer
"<UNK>, could you repeat the last question.",non-answer
"Okay, okay (multiple speakers).",non-answer
Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated.,non-answer
Our comments today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G.,non-answer
"The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the relevant GAAP financial information and other information required by Regulation G is provided in the Company's earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations website.",non-answer
"Again, that's investor.",non-answer
"Now I'd like to introduce <UNK> <UNK>, the Chairman, CEO and President of Scholastic, to begin today's presentation.",non-answer
"Thank you, <UNK>.",non-answer
I was very excited about that because talent is such a key driver for success for any organization.,non-answer
My time -- I am spending time here in the US.,non-answer
This is our core market.,non-answer
"But also making sure that the market, the priority international markets are visited and we work together.",non-answer
"So I'm spending a lot of time here, but also a lot of time on a plane.",non-answer
Okay.,non-answer
"I would like to thank everyone for participating today, and we look forward to talking with you on our next conference call.",non-answer
"Again, thank you very much.",non-answer
"If there is any more questions, please give us a call.",non-answer
"Otherwise, thank you very much, and we'll be talking in the next 90 days.",non-answer
Yes.,non-answer
"Thanks, everyone.",non-answer
Bye-bye.,non-answer
"You know, I think it's been competitive for a while.",answer
I think there's always going to be a little bit of movement up and down between the quarters.,answer
There's pressure on used; there's pressure on new.,answer
"The transparency of the Internet and everything that's involved, I think we are fairly stable.",answer
"Over the next two years, we will certainly add the techs that we need to.",answer
Our facilities aren't at capacity.,answer
"So the data I spoke to in my opening comments was that in Q2, components shipments was -- includes cards and components.",answer
"And that is somewhere around the area of 50% of our overall shipments in the quarter, Q2.",answer
"In Q3 alone, that number will be cut by 30%, as we start to the transition of what you just highlighted, away from component and card sales, to mobile and SSDs.",answer
"Part of that dynamic, by the way, and discussing how this plays out, is we now will be shipping, in the quarter, 16 nanometer MLC qualified drives that were in process, and didn't have that volume in Q2.",answer
"Okay, thanks very much, and thanks to all of you for your interest in DSW, your support of DSW and your excellent questions.",non-answer
Have a great day.,non-answer
Happy St.Patty's Day.,non-answer
That's really not a metric that we track.,answer
We have a big variety of clients that pay us different price points for different types of users.,answer
So it's really not one that we pay attention to.,answer
"I think it's pretty evenly split down the middle, to be honest with you.",answer
Particularly on the buy side.,answer
This is <UNK>.,non-answer
The $3.2 million is predominantly in the SG&A line.,answer
That's a great question.,non-answer
This is <UNK> <UNK>.,non-answer
sentence,label
And the pace of some of the construction projects that we do at that business and when they're proved and when they actually start putting shovels in the ground are going to drive the timing of the demand for capital.,answer
"So, there's a lot of factors that come into play there.",answer
We do.,non-answer
One second.,non-answer
Are you talking total or just the utility.,non-answer
Give me a second.,non-answer
I have the number.,non-answer
I just have to dig it out.,non-answer
"Any other questions while we're, while I'm rooting through my papers.",non-answer
This is <UNK> <UNK>.,non-answer
I can take that one.,non-answer
We are looking to surpass that number in 2015 and do even better.,answer
"And I would say, as much from our business but also having just been in New York during fashion week and seeing what was being talked about, what was in the showrooms, what the news was in denim, I'm not going to call a turn in the denim business, but I'm feeling, for the most part -- I'm feeling now differently than I felt for a while, which is that she's probably coming back to denim in a way that we haven't seen her be for several quarters.",answer
So encouraged there.,answer
But it's early days.,answer
Tops is tough right now.,answer
And it's wovens and knits.,answer
It's a fit issue.,answer
It's a fit intent issue.,answer
"As we get better at this, we will start to look more expansively and look at some of these other deals that are out there that can take us into new geographies where we feel we need to be playing.",answer
And then the other thing is we need to start -- the third bucket we are looking at is capabilities.,answer
"I am quite convinced there is going to be a post-acute world where we are going to have to have more tools as we want to take on risk in bundling, which I think will come back.",answer
There will be a 2.0 version of this.,answer
So I think we will want to think about that as well.,answer
"We are focused on having this matter reviewed on the merits, and as you point out, we are fortunate that it looks like we are going to be able to do that early in the new year.",answer
So we will look forward to again this being reviewed in its entirety.,answer
"And as you know and as we have said before, we feel we have a very strong intellectual property patent estate on this product.",answer
"And we demonstrated in the past our determination to assert our IP rights and defend them, and that's what we look forward to doing for this product early next year.",answer
"But what we're talking about right now, in terms of the next number of quarters being up a little bit, I think it's more related to some of the short-term dynamic around technology ramps and new product introductions.",answer
"And with that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.",non-answer
"If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.",non-answer
"During the course of this call, we may have made forward-looking statements regarding the Company and the industry.",non-answer
"You will see more color, brand-appropriate color, coming back into the business by the time we get to summer.",answer
So that's a change that has been made.,answer
"Print and pattern, obviously, as we get into late spring and summer -- not so much in spring, but you'll see a bit more of that when we get into summer as well.",answer
And then as we move into fall there's a little bit more.,answer
And then the work that's going on right now on holiday is holiday for Gap is really a time for very a optimistic oppression of the brand.,answer
And so I'm not going to call a turn on the business right now.,answer
I'm being very honest with you about the work that's going on and when you will start to see some change and I'm not promising anything until we get later in the year.,answer
"But I think even as we get to summer and the fall, we'll start to see the brand shift a little more to be expressed through the appropriate filters of the brand.",answer
"I'll let <UNK> grab the specific number, if she wants to talk about that.",non-answer
"And when you consider that we've got probably 10X that in our total assortment, 10X to 2,000 or 2,500, there is a wealth of additional choices out there for the customer.",answer
"And I think you know, from day one when we started opening these small format stores, we said the key is going to be to open up the full assortment to those customers, because they're already looking at a reduced choice count in terms of what shoes are physically in that store.",answer
"We saw sales actually accelerate from our expectations and, of course that equated to more points being earned and more of a margin headwind, because of that, because people are more engaged, and it's easier to understand.",answer
"Yes, we haven't really seen that.",answer
"Again, it's a different scale now.",answer
"We've got the whole country on this program, and I can just tell you from the inside, we are very excited about what this program provides to the Company, and the opportunities that we're going to have to drive more engagement, more focused offers to our guests, by using our CRM tool.",answer
We focused very heavily on the 50 to 500 in that midmarket space and I think that's been a very good sweet spot for us.,answer
"We certainly have clients that are above that, but we're really focusing the team on that 50 to 500.",answer
It's a very hot space right now for multiple products.,answer
Those are the clients that need multiple products that are integrated and SaaS-based and we fit really well there.,answer
What I mentioned earlier is over the next six months you'll see even stronger integration.,answer
"So, all on kind of the same user interface and so forth.",answer
"But again, we will have a better view, obviously, as we get through the second quarter, and sort of talk to our customers, and see how it flows.",answer
"But right now on a full-year basis, as I suggested, we are dealing still solid that -- of what we called, which is for the industry to be up low single digits and for us to have another solid year in commercial.",answer
"I've seen the spreadsheet, but -- again, it's sort of -- it's all in the $20 million.",answer
Yes.,non-answer
"So, the great thing, the exciting thing about <UNK> right now is that we have access to so many countries, so we get to really look at what are the best cities to go into, and, so, for us, you're going to see places, we think, this year like Shanghai, like Beijing, like Auckland, a couple in Europe.",answer
I can name Rotterdam and Stuttgart and then us fill in in the US with four or five.,answer
"So, it will sprinkle around the world.",answer
So it will be a little bit of a step-up but not significantly.,answer
I think the latter.,answer
I think hopefully we were somewhat consistent two or three quarters ago when we began to add more inventory and we tried to call out that will put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward three or four quarters and here we are.,answer
So it was certainly down this quarter.,answer
We don't anticipate it going down further necessarily for the next two quarters.,answer
But we expect it to hang around that kind of number.,answer
Thank you.,non-answer

We believe that we have some good opportunities that will help this year.,answer
And we have been doing that for years.,non-answer
"If trends don't change, we are likely going to increase prices.",answer
"If something happened in the economy, or something happened with our trends, we might defer it.",answer
We would probably get it done by the end of the third quarter.,answer
"So if we saw something unusual happen, we might defer it just so that we don't exasperate the challenge, but if the trends stay as they are, we are underpriced on steak right now.",answer
We're just not charging the going rate.,answer
"We actually lose money anytime somebody comes in thinking about getting chicken and instead gets steak, for example.",answer
We also continue to explore building a new plant.,answer
We believe that permitting now is possible but a go/no go decision would have to wait until the industry has better economics.,answer
We also are looking at opportunities to buy plants and with the industry doing a little worse those opportunities may come.,answer
We have nothing imminent but again we buy opportunistically and we look to if the industry goes into a prolonged slump there may be that opportunity like there was in the past to buy plants and we plan on being there.,answer
"I think we -- first of all, we have some good programs, as I mentioned earlier, industrial, medical, and defense that we're able to diversify the customer base in the last 12 months.",answer
So we have some of those programs to help us.,answer
Same thing in embedded computing and storage.,answer
"We've got some new customers that we got qualified, and that's really what we are counting on.",answer
"Now, at the same time, we are positioned to win some programs, but we are not putting those at the forecast at this time.",answer

"Thank you, <UNK>.",non-answer
Yes.,non-answer
"The first one there was NoMa, north of Massachusetts, and we had a second now we're doing a couple others in other markets.",answer
"But I don't want to suggest for a minute that you'll see 6,200 NoMas with 1,000 square feet across the franchise.",non-answer
"I think it's a bit of everything, meaning that there is some hub-and-spoke where you have a larger established branch or a store that's been there for many years.",answer
And then you have others around that maybe wouldn't be as large.,answer
"So the margin for error is very, very small.",answer
But right now I wouldn't expect it to be a negative comp.,answer
But it's going to be close so we are hoping for the best.,answer
"Yes, it was like 6.1% was menu price.",answer
"Most of the rest of the transaction, there was a small piece, <UNK>, that wasn't transaction.",answer
But even that was greater group size than catering which even now is our light transactions because you are serving more people.,answer
There wasn't anything in terms of people buying different items on the menu that caused the check to go up.,answer
"So it was -- menu price is the biggest piece, 6.1.",answer
"So, I'm not saying that we are going to have dramatic improvement in market conditions in second quarter.",non-answer
I'm saying that we've made -- we've taken actions to put a cost structure in place that will allow us to improve our profit margins and improve our profitability on the business that we have available to us.,answer

We are doing everything we can to get the sales that the market will allow.,answer

Yes.,non-answer
Most value you would expect to see more towards the second half of the year as we get a little bit more clarity on what some of the requirements are.,answer
But I'd expect it to be below where we were for 2014.,answer
I think the answer is we're spending a very small amount right now as a group as we do all the preliminary work at the various approvals done and the like.,answer
I believe that the real dollars are not really expected to be spent in a significant amount until 2017.,non-answer
"I'm sorry, until 2016.",non-answer
Sorry.,non-answer
So it probably won't be a lot that goes out this year.,answer
"We've gathered the data from our customers, which is very detailed data, and they share a lot of information with us that we can't talk about.",non-answer
But we see it.,non-answer
"So assuming that those forecasts are correct, we believe the second half of the calendar year 2015 will be better than what we saw -- or what we're seeing right now in the first half of this calendar year.",answer
So that's really what we based on it.,answer
"At the same time, we're looking at what programs are involved, what the future of these new programs.",non-answer
"So I'm more optimistic, first of all, our customer base today in the com is smaller.",non-answer
"But again, in general, I think we're set up, you know, a little bit better going into 2015, than we were 2014.",answer
I think it's about the same.,answer
"I mean, it's very robust.",answer
We're pleased with it.,answer
"Again, a lot of opportunities in all facets of the private sector for us.",answer
"And you know, again, a lot of those are design-build type things in the private sector which, you know, can take on -- you know, can draw out the letting and award process, if you will, particularly when you're in the private sector, you know, realize that oftentimes there are no -- there are no hard bid dates.",answer

So we will continue to invest in that business.,answer
I expect that it will continue to grow.,answer
"I think we really like to get to the second part of your question, <UNK>, what Oneida brings to that set of businesses.",answer
It is one of the more attractive elements of the Oneida transaction.,answer
"They have got a nonbanking -- set of nonbanking businesses including insurance, benefits administration and wealth management.",answer
"What we're concerned about and what we've heard most of our competition say is that their receipts are delayed up to five, six, and in some cases more weeks than that.",answer
So what we're concerned about is that we're going to see these missed time floor sets start to hit post-Easter into April and May and then what that is going to potentially do to the promotional environment later in the quarter and into the beginning of second.,answer
So that's really what we're trying to call out.,answer
"Sure, thanks, <UNK>.",non-answer
On the product side for the quarter we had very consistent performance.,non-answer
"Anything else other than that, I really can't make any comments about.",non-answer
"But, we have a holistic approach here to continuing to grow.",non-answer
I'm going to just come back to the standard line.,non-answer
I just don't think we have the ability to get into detail about that at this time.,non-answer

Bye.,non-answer
"Well, thank you all.",non-answer

"We've also agreed to enter into a three-year agreement with Universal, NBC Universal, a first look at our trade publishing properties for live-action movies.",answer
This gives us an opportunity to work with this top studio that has a direct stake in ensuring that our properties can become outstanding motion pictures.,answer

"Our third quarter revenue grew by just over 2% to $382.1 million, and excluding one-time items, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.59, an improvement over a loss of $0.68 last year.",answer
"Before I get to the detail behind our operating performance, I'd like to quickly review the one-time, mostly non-cash, items for the quarter which were $0.09 per share in total.",answer
"As you may recall, we had a one-time net benefit of $0.30 per share in the third quarter last year which included a favorable settlement of outstanding federal tax audits.",answer
"Cost of goods sold excluding one-time items increased about 1% to 52% of sales mostly due to higher free book promotions in Clubs, Minecraft margins, higher cost of product due to foreign exchange in Canada, higher trade fulfillment costs in Australia, and higher product amortization in our Educational Technology business.",answer
SG&A excluding one-time items was essentially flat to the prior year.,answer
Now turning to our segment results.,non-answer
"As part of the restructuring, we shifted audio and video book operations to be part of our Trade Publishing group.",answer
The audio and video book sales will now be reported as part of Children's Book Publishing and Distribution beginning in the fourth quarter.,answer
"Corporate overhead in the third quarter was $19.4 million compared to $11.2 million in the prior year period, excluding one-time items.",answer
"This increase was primarily due to higher planned investment in corporate level information technology in the current quarter to improve our data, analytics and selling capabilities.",answer
So it will be a little bit of a step-up but not significantly.,answer
I think the latter.,answer
I think hopefully we were somewhat consistent two or three quarters ago when we began to add more inventory and we tried to call out that will put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward three or four quarters and here we are.,answer
So it was certainly down this quarter.,answer
We don't anticipate it going down further necessarily for the next two quarters.,answer
But we expect it to hang around that kind of number.,answer
Thank you.,non-answer
I think we said that it was probably around 15 basis points.,answer

"But, I think right now, we are confident that the prudent level of 6% to 8% for window shipments, 5% to 7% all-in for our revenue, that's where we're comfortable right now.",answer
I think the only thing we can say definitively is that we have certain customers that clearly are outperforming the market in the R&R space.,answer
"We have not seen a general positive significant increase in R&R, but the reality is, as we've tried to articulate before, we truly do not know where our product ends up.",answer
"So we are in conversations, and that is moving forward.",answer
"No, I would say it's -- our inventory as a whole turns out about four times a year, so three months is still a reasonable assumption.",answer
"If anything, it might actually turn a little bit less than that because (technical difficulty).",answer
Housings are the things -- we're hearing a noise.,non-answer
That's why we're pausing here.,non-answer

"I would say just to temper this all, we saw this coming three quarters ago.",answer
"We do still feel like the year was a 9% op margin year, and our guidance is telling you that we are 10% next year.",answer
"Definitely, you can hear through <UNK>'s comments about acquisitions, we feel strongly that if we can get bigger, we can really start pulling operating leverage out of this business, and I think for the first time since we have been doing this, remember we had three straight years of $4 million in op income, and we have finally broken out of that to the $6.3 million number.",answer
"We call that our hedging docket, which is going to be open this year and hopefully completed this year.",answer
That will tell us whether we've got the right amount of gas reserves in our portfolio or not.,answer
"Hopefully, we'll get through that this year and it will give some direction on a future deal.",answer

"We believe more and more we're going to see replacement of windows on a room-by-room basis, on a window-by-window basis, and potentially at a lower price point window, such that you would buy it in Home Depot and Lowe's, and have them maybe install it, rather than what we saw in the last boom which was this complete replacement.",answer
"So, I think the market's changed, and it becomes more difficult to be able to ascertain does any component go into a window that's going to end up in R&R.",answer
Does it end up in new construction.,non-answer
Much more difficult to track now.,non-answer
It's about a third.,answer
Order of magnitude.,non-answer
"So I think we see low-single-digit growth, for sure, in that business.",answer
But that's what we see coming in the future.,answer

"So one thing you may have seen in our stores, <UNK>, is we just put up a new signing package that speaks to more styles, more colors, more widths, more sizes, and that, in a pretty obvious way, is announcing to our customer that there's much more beyond just what you see in the store.",answer
"And in the ten technology test stores, that message will be even clearer to the customer.",answer
"Yes, we've got seven of them open right now.",non-answer
"And the first two opened in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter of 2013, so most of them aren't even comparable.",non-answer

So I think we're headed in a really good direction on this.,answer
Okay.,non-answer
Thank you for that plug.,non-answer
"First of all, it is a small number of actually enacted ones; it is an increasing number of people who are interested in engaging along those standpoints.",answer

Our expectation is that we will sign a big UP deal this year.,answer
I would also say sales guidance is not necessarily contingent upon delivering a large UP deal.,answer
"If we close one of the large UP deals that <UNK>'s talking about, it is likely going to push us over our SNET guidance range.",answer
We will provide that update at that time.,non-answer
Good morning.,non-answer
"In part, we had a strong sales in 2014.",answer
So we will begin to get benefits of those sales in 2015.,answer
The cornerstone for that growth was the record level of customers we obtained via conversions from other fuels.,answer
"We obtained almost 5,800 new customers in 2014 and as we look at that, that 5,800 is -- not only is it a record but it's 10% above the record we set last year for conversions.",answer
So we continue to make good progress in that area.,answer
"With the margin increase from new rates that took effect in October, each residential heat customer is now worth $293 of annual net margin to SJG.",answer
The places that we encourage them to move will change as the programs change.,answer
"But many of the 3 million customers are happy, loyal customers.",answer
And what we're trying to do is change the commercial arrangement between us.,answer
And we will continue to do that by making a variety of offerings.,answer
So there's nothing like -- that ended or expired.,non-answer
"There's still a lot of options, in terms of how we go addressing ways to get those customers into the new model.",non-answer
Yes.,non-answer
"<UNK>, I think you hit the nail on the head.",non-answer
I think it's a really important point.,non-answer
"Number one, I personally believe that as we continue to improve the mix that we can -- even at this revenue, I think there's a potential to improve the margin, some of the things that we are doing.",answer
"We do also have a fair amount of new opportunities, customers that we won, the projects that we won, that will help us as these go out.",answer
"And number three, I think we have a very good pipeline of opportunities that we are going to be working on, in the last year, that I believe is going to benefit us in the second half, especially second half of the calendar year.",answer
"And the business model, in particular, is looking to be very promising for them.",answer

And now we've accomplished 187-day balloon duration.,answer
"So, look, we are excited about where this can go, long term, and this year is going to be about commercialization efforts.",answer
We don't expect a significant ramp in terms of production units this year.,answer

"Yes, <UNK>, it's very hard to predict quarter by quarter.",non-answer
"I look at this as a very substantial three-year trend where we now have 1,800 restaurants, we're now $2.5 million, a fact that we have added $500,000 in volume while adding the 600 restaurants to talk about over the last three years at think is pretty substantial.",answer
"If you go back to the three years before that, that was a three-year trend as well that had a start and stop and it was pretty clean.2010, 2011, and 2012.",answer
They stuck with us through our difficult days and now all of us are quite optimistic about our ability to drive those businesses.,answer
Probably the thing that's the least understood by many is our attractions to the exclusive brands.,answer
"Quite honestly, Sephora is just such a great opportunity for people to experience beauty in a completely different way.",answer
It's been greatly received by customers.,answer
We're now in 492 locations and continue to grow that business.,answer
It's a centerpiece of center core as fine jewelry is.,answer
During that three-year period.,non-answer
"And you can see where it started, you can see where it ended, and that was about a 27% or 28% or 29% increase.",answer
And so we seem to have these waves.,answer
"And if you go back even as we are a private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exist, they like it, they come back more often.",answer
And so we have this kind of surge and then we have a leveling off and we have a surge and a leveling off.,answer

"However, we believe we remain very well positioned from both a capital and an operational perspective for the expected Oneida financial integration in the third quarter of this year.",answer
I will now turn it back over to Nicole to open the line for any questions.,non-answer
Sure.,non-answer
"Origination volume was lower, and pay down volume was higher.",answer
"That, I guess, was experienced across all of the portfolios.",answer
"It was more acute in the auto lending portfolio, which has cash run off of about $30 million a month.",answer
And we have been doing that for years.,non-answer
"If trends don't change, we are likely going to increase prices.",answer
"If something happened in the economy, or something happened with our trends, we might defer it.",answer
We would probably get it done by the end of the third quarter.,answer
"So if we saw something unusual happen, we might defer it just so that we don't exasperate the challenge, but if the trends stay as they are, we are underpriced on steak right now.",answer
We're just not charging the going rate.,answer
"We actually lose money anytime somebody comes in thinking about getting chicken and instead gets steak, for example.",answer
"Right now the main focuses are the UK, certainly China, and then Brazil we are also, as I mentioned in my remarks, seeing very good traction.",answer
I just want to -- the performance-based pay was down for the quarter $2.1 million.,answer
I think at the end of the third quarter we also announced that it was down for the whole year.,answer
"We don't give out specifically that number, but based on the performance of the company this year, we did not have any performance-based compensation.",answer
I guess I will address a piece of that and then others can follow.,non-answer
We also continue to explore building a new plant.,answer
We believe that permitting now is possible but a go/no go decision would have to wait until the industry has better economics.,answer
We also are looking at opportunities to buy plants and with the industry doing a little worse those opportunities may come.,answer
We have nothing imminent but again we buy opportunistically and we look to if the industry goes into a prolonged slump there may be that opportunity like there was in the past to buy plants and we plan on being there.,answer
So we would like to fix that.,answer
"But if we decided -- if there were some trends that we were a little concerned about, we might decide to fix that a quarter or two later.",answer
"But right now, unless things change, I think we're going to get this done by the third quarter.",answer
I will take the comp piece first.,non-answer
"When I look at the first quarter, you are right that in 2013 there was -- we lost a day, so that 1%, is really like a 2% comp, so you can make that adjustment.",answer
"I think we -- first of all, we have some good programs, as I mentioned earlier, industrial, medical, and defense that we're able to diversify the customer base in the last 12 months.",answer
So we have some of those programs to help us.,answer
Same thing in embedded computing and storage.,answer
"We've got some new customers that we got qualified, and that's really what we are counting on.",answer
"Now, at the same time, we are positioned to win some programs, but we are not putting those at the forecast at this time.",answer
"<UNK>, could you repeat the last question.",non-answer
"Okay, okay (multiple speakers).",non-answer
"There's also an adjustment to be made and I'm suggesting it's 100, 200 basis points in the first quarter and that's an estimate -- it's our best estimate right now.",answer
"And so the three-year comp, if you make those adjustments, you're talking about something in the 26%, 27% or so range.",answer
"And if you do that and if you look out at the rest of the year and listen, we do things like we adjust for trading day and things like that, I think the third-quarter in the fourth quarter will be tough comparisons.",answer
"I don't think the traffic will turn negative, but it will get close.",answer
"So the margin for error is very, very small.",answer
But right now I wouldn't expect it to be a negative comp.,answer
But it's going to be close so we are hoping for the best.,answer
"Yes, it was like 6.1% was menu price.",answer
"Most of the rest of the transaction, there was a small piece, <UNK>, that wasn't transaction.",answer
But even that was greater group size than catering which even now is our light transactions because you are serving more people.,answer
There wasn't anything in terms of people buying different items on the menu that caused the check to go up.,answer
"So it was -- menu price is the biggest piece, 6.1.",answer
With respect to material inflation it has somewhat slowed.,answer
"It wasn't zero in the quarter, we still had an impact in our fiscal third quarter, but the pace is certainly slowed down.",answer
"Fuel is certainly down, as well, which helps from a transportation perspective.",answer
"That was a slight benefit for us in the quarter, as well.",answer
We're starting our process now as we go through our budget exercise and looking external data to tell us what we think the most likely fuel price will be going forward.,answer
So nothing really specific there to offer other than we're in the midst of doing our ground work on that.,answer
"We think this year is much more likely to be on a go-forward basis, we're able to deliver margins that are accretive to profitability.",answer
So we think there's still more upside there.,answer
I can't quantify what it will look like.,non-answer
Our new clearance strategy in shoes and throughout the store is resonating with customers.,answer
They like the idea we have clearance zone that they can find.,answer
"And we're selling in shoes, for example, selling more on the first markdown as opposed to the third markdown by the way we are marketing it.",answer
So I think our people are motivated to sell it well.,answer
"But again, in general, I think we're set up, you know, a little bit better going into 2015, than we were 2014.",answer
I think it's about the same.,answer
"I mean, it's very robust.",answer
We're pleased with it.,answer
"Again, a lot of opportunities in all facets of the private sector for us.",answer
"And you know, again, a lot of those are design-build type things in the private sector which, you know, can take on -- you know, can draw out the letting and award process, if you will, particularly when you're in the private sector, you know, realize that oftentimes there are no -- there are no hard bid dates.",non-answer

"What we're concerned about and what we've heard most of our competition say is that their receipts are delayed up to five, six, and in some cases more weeks than that.",answer
So what we're concerned about is that we're going to see these missed time floor sets start to hit post-Easter into April and May and then what that is going to potentially do to the promotional environment later in the quarter and into the beginning of second.,answer
So that's really what we're trying to call out.,answer
"Sure, thanks, <UNK>.",non-answer
On the product side for the quarter we had very consistent performance.,non-answer
"We've still got a lot to learn, but we like the fact that at three stores, it's very manageable.",answer
And we think the smart thing to do is continue to work on those stores.,answer
There are some more technologies coming to play in those stores.,answer
There could be -- we are working with our technology partners.,answer
We are working with our financing partners.,answer
"We are experimenting with a number of different things and it's -- we think it's just right the way we are doing it, and this is what we want to stay focused on right now.",answer
